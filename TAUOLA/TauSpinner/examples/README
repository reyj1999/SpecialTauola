This directory contains examples of TauSpinner use.
They are intended to present different options of TauSpinner
and as a starting point for user analysis.

###############
# Compilation #
###############

- If using LCG scripts, check if Tauola++ was compiled with TauSpinner library
  If using default scripts, execute ./configure providing paths to HepMC
  (and optionally to MC-TESTER)
- Make sure that ROOT configuration is available through 'root-config' and
  that the lhapdf has correct path for datasets
- Check that the dataset MSTW2008nnlo90cl.LHgrid exists
- Execute 'make'

########################
# Running the examples #
########################

NOTE: As described in the paper, examples are prepared to work with input
      files in HepMC::IO_GenEvent format but can easily be adapted to any
      other input format.

1)
Executing ./tau-reweight-test.exe will run the test on the sample 'events.dat'
provided with the distribution. The output should show:

No of events processed for spin weight: 100
WT average for these events: 1.11409

To test the default setup with any other sample, execute:

./tau-reweight-test.exe <input_file>

2)
To run the second example, execute:

./tau-reweight-CLEO-to-RChL.exe <input_file> [<events_limit>]

If no events limit is provided, all events from the file will be analyzed.

Note that decay channels that Tauola++ does not have new currents implemented,
the resulting weight will be 1.0




In these examples, weights resulting from TauSpinner processing are used only
in an MC-TESTER analysis. If MC-TESTER is used, an output file mc-tester.root
will be produced with the distributions after reweighting. It can be compared
with results before reweighting to show the differences.
