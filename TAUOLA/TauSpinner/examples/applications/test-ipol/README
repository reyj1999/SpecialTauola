Test for Ipol options of TauSpinner
-----------------------------------

To redo the test:

## 1 ##

Generate HepMC data samples using Tauola++ with the following settings:
(if different filenames are used, next steps may require modifications)

  1) /tmp/ipol.polarized.hepmc

     Default Tauola++ settings
     
     Sample will be analyzed with Ipol = 0

  2) /tmp/ipol.unpolarized.hepmc

     Set Tauola::spin_correlation.setAll(false)
     
     Sample will be analyzed with Ipol = 1

  3) /tmp/ipol.modified.plzap0.hepmc

     Modify src/tauolaFortranInterfaces/tauola_extras.f
     so that PLZAP0 always returns 0.5
     
     Sample will be analyzed with Ipol = 2

  4) /tmp/ipol.modified.costhe0.hepmc

     Modify src/tauolaFortranInterfaces/tauola_extras.f
     so that in PLZAP0 COSTHE = 0.0 and IDE = 11
     
     Sample will be analyzed with Ipol = 3

## 2 ##

Compile test-ipol.exe (executing 'make' in this directory should be enough)

Check if the filenames of the datafiles are correct and execute 'test-ipol-runall.sh'
This will create 4 rootfiles with results of the analysis of the above samples
Each sample will be analyzed with proper Ipol setting
The polarized sample (sample 1) will be used as benchmark only

test-ipol-runall.sh is set up to analyze 1M events.
Change if necessary (even 100k is enough)

## 3 ##

When the analysis is complete run:

root -b -q test-ipol.C

This will reproduce all .eps files from 'test-ipol-plots' directory

## 4 ##

make in test-ipol-plots

The results show spectrum of pi- energy / tau- energy

Red line is always the benchmark (polarized) sample.
Green line comes from the 2nd sample generated to test appropriate ipol value (see point 1)

- left-hand plots have green line without any weights
- right-hand plots have green line with weight calculated with appropriate ipol applied

- Page 1 contains results from all events, without any cuts
- Page 2 contains results for events where costheta' < 0.0
- Page 3 contains results for events where costheta' > 0.0

All right-hand plot should show green line matching red line
See 'test-ipol.BENCHMARK.pdf' to see an example result for 1Mevents
