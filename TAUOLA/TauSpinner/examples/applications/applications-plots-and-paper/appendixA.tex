\section{Benchmark results}\label{sec:OutputTest} 

The Appendix A with its subsections represents output%
\footnote{ Text is adopted for the sake of paper preparation in 
a minor way only.}
from a single execution of {\tt applications-plots.exe} program.
The numerical results of the Appendix  are obtained  
from the  events file  generated 
 by run of {\tt Pythia8} combined  with {\tt Tauola++}, details of initialization  
are given later in the Appendix. 
For the fits,  all 100 bins except 
the first five in $\tau \to l \nu_l \nu_\tau $ case  and first one in $\tau \to \pi \nu$ case, were used\footnotemark[18].
\footnotetext[18]{If bremsstrahlung in $\tau$ decays would be present, the result of the fits would differ.
For example, for leptonic channel (see Fig.3), the shift of $\sim$0.07 would be present.}
%For the plots, neighboring bins were
%combined. 


The figures in the main part of our 
paper are taken from the ones of Appendices, with somewhat improved graphic style 
for better readability. 
%In particular, 
%figures \ref{Fig:spectra} and \ref{Fig:scattergams} have been taken from present Appendix. 
For the plots of Fig.~1,  the bottom-left plots 
 Figs.~\ref{Fig:spectra1},~\ref{Fig:spectra2}~and~\ref{Fig:spectra3}, were selected.
The lego plot (and visible mass plots) of Fig.~2 are shown as the top-left lego plots (and mid-right plots)
of Figs.~\ref{Fig:spectra2}~and~\ref{Fig:scattergrams2} respectively.



%For the plots in the main text of the paper,   
%modifications to improve presentation were introduced.

\subsection{W decays}\label{Sec:W}
The invariant mass distribution and break-down on the $\tau$ decay channels are shown
for $\tau \nu_\tau$-pair originating from $W$ decay. The spin effects should not depend on the virtuality of the
$W$ intermediate state, but this may be not the case if New Physics samples are studied.

\subsection{Z decays}\label{Sec:Z}

The invariant mass distribution and break-down on the $\tau$ decay channels are shown
for $\tau \tau$-pair originating from $Z$ decay.
The spin effects strongly depend on the virtuality of the
$Z/\gamma^*$ intermediate state. Events were generated explicitly requiring virtuality
of $Z\gamma^*$ within 88-94 GeV window. Minor 
contamination from some other process is nevertheless observed (we have not traced it back).
