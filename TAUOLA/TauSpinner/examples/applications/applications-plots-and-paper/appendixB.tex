\section{$\Phi$ decays: Z decay sample but with Higgs couplings used for  spin }\label{sec:OutputH} 
 
In this section, we monitor effects of Higgs couplings for spin correlations
and compare it with case of unpolarized $\tau$'s.
As expected, one can observe strong opposite sign as in $Z$ case, 
spin correlations, and there is  no effect on single $\tau$ decay product spectra.

\setcounter{figure}{0}

The invariant mass distribution and break-down on the $\tau$ decay channels are shown
for $\tau \nu_\tau$-pair originating from $\Phi$ decay.
For this purpose $Z \to \tau \tau$ events were used, with $\tau$ decay products removed 
and $\tau$ leptons decayed again using configuration of {\tt Tauola++} like for $H \to \tau \tau$ decay.
For the fits,  all 100 bins except 
the first five in $\tau \to l \nu_l \nu_\tau $ case  and first one in $\tau \to \pi \nu$ case,  were used.
%For the plots, neighboring bins were
%combined.

%\subsection{Z decays}\label{Sec:H}

%\The purpose of the following plot is to check what is the spectrum of the 
%\$\tau$-pair mass. The spin effects strongly depend on the virtuality of the
%\$\Phi$ (in fact $Z/\gamma^*$) intermediate state which may differ from particular sets of files to other. We expected all events to  remain  close to the resonance peak. Minor 
%\contamination from some other process was  identified thanks to the plot.
