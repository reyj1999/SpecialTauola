This program adding fits to the histograms stored in root-files generated
by 'applications-plots.exe' located in 'applications' directory.

Compile: make
     or: make applications-fits/applications-fits.exe

Run:     ./applications-fits.exe <config_file>

List of assumptions made by this program:

1) Subdirectory provided in config file already exists
   (default directory name is 'applications-plots-and-paper')
   All plots and .txt files will be stored in this subdirectory
2) Names of the input files can be set in applications-fits.conf

Input files:
------------
Histograms are separated into three categories: events from Z boson,
W boson and events from analysis of Higgs-like polarization.
The program can process several files at a time containing histograms
from any of the above categories. They don't have to contain all three
categories. The category is determined by the content (see README
in 'applications' for histogram naming convention).

If two or more files contain histograms from the same category,
the result will be overwritten and only the result from last processed
file will be stored.

List of files to be processed, output directory and fitting ranges are
controlled by a configuration file. An example configuration file
'applications-fits.conf' is provided. Three example
input files, with all three categories separated, are provided as well.
They can be used to redo the plots of the publication.
