It is often necessary to change some of the tauola input parameters like branching
ratios tau mass etc etc. It ic convenient to have it done centrally.
The purpose of this directory is exactly that.
Here one can create the .F files for interfaces of Tauola to different programs 
out of singly defined blocks. More precisely:

KK:             prod/Tauface.F             --> ../tauola-F/tauface-KK-F/Tauface.F
demo-jetset:    prod/tauola_photos_ini.F   --> ../tauola-F/jetset-F/tauola_photos_ini.F
demo:           prod/taumain.F             --> ../tauola-F/standalone-F/taumain.F

where the arrows are pointing to the final adresses of the files.

How to use?
===========

1)The parts of the routines have to be updated in directory ./source by hand.
  The parts wich should rather not be modified are write protected.
2)With the help of script 'klej' files  prod/Tauface.F  prod/tauola_photos_ini.F prod/taumain.F
  will be created. Automatic check -- comparison with the archive versions stored in
  directory ./back will be also performed.

3) Finally commands:

cp             prod/Tauface.F              ../tauola-F/tauface-KK-F/Tauface.F
cp             prod/tauola_photos_ini.F    ../tauola-F/jetset-F/tauola_photos_ini.F
cp             prod/taumain.F              ../tauola-F/standalone-F/taumain.F

place all where it is needed.
