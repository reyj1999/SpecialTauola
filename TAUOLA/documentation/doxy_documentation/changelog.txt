Changelog for changes with respect to version 1.0
-------------------------------------------------

General note:
- For use with Athena (compilation on 64bit platform):
  once ./configure  script is executed add in make.inc "-m32" to CFLAGS.
  The make.inc is placed in the  main directory.

2014.VI.4
- version change: Tauola++ v1.1.5, TauSpinner v1.4.0
- examples and config scripts adapted to HepMC interface change
  in Pythia8.180 or later
- removed simplifications imposed on events generated with Pythia8
  in examples/testing/ directory. Now events are generated with default
  Pythia8 setup. Keep in mind that all your new results
  generated for tests will have FSR and ISR
  effects in produced samples, agreement with the reference results may 
  expose the consequences (which disapear once  you switch off FSR and ISR).

2014.VI.3
- Functionality of TauSpinner extended. Transverse spin effects in Higgs-like 
  object decays to pair of tau leptons and in its main background Drell-Yan
  process installed. This is for Higgs CP parity studies. 
- for this purpose, added additional directory TauSpinner/examples/CP-tests
- documentation for these changes: preprint IFJPAN-IV-2014-9
  by T. Przedzinski, E. Richter-Was and Z. Was, ``TauSpinner: a tool for 
  simulating CP effects in ...''
 
2014.IV.17
- Fix for cases when TauSpinner is used after Tauola++ generation.
  The case when this combination is used in KKMC needs testing.

2014.IV.03
- Added Tauola::setSeed( int, int, int ) for setting seed for TAUOLA-FORTRAN
  random number generator

2013.XII.11
- Consistency of documentation makefile comments README files etc. 
  Exceptional configurations of unusual origins of energy-momentum 
  conservation repeated.  We could not explore all options
  of production file formats. Users feed-back is needed, outcome must
  wait for the future release.
2013.XII.09
- version change: Tauola++ v1.1.4, TauSpinner v1.3.2
- new validation tests for TauSpinner added. They are available under sub-directory
  TauSpinner/examples/tauspinner-validation. tauspinner-validation-plots.cxx
  has been moved to this directory as well
- check is now performed whether PDG value provided through function
  Tauola::setHiggsScalarPseudoscalarPDG points to a particle of charge 0.
2013.XI.29
- option of reweighting CLEO to RChL currents using TauSpinner updated
  and tested. An example 'tau-reweight-CLEO-to-RChL.cxx' added
- unlucky choice of an example value for Tauola::setHiggsScalarPseudoscalarPDG in documentation
  changed from 24 to 35
2013.XI.18
- fixed initialization for tauola radiation in leptonic decay channels
2013.X.29
- added RChL currents for 3-pi channel and Belle currents for 2-pi channel
- new option 'Tauola::setNewCurrents(int mode)' for switching between
  CLEO (mode=0) and RChL (mode=1) added
- TauSpinner version changed to v1.3.1; added option Ipol=3
2013.X.16
- template for TauSpinner validation added
- an example (examples/tauspinner-validation-plots.cxx) for generating
  plots for this paper has been added
2013.VI.12
- include files cleaned up. Now it is required only to include main directory
  TAUOLA/include
- LCG scripts updated; added configuration option --enable-debug
2013.V.28
- Compatible with FORTRAN version, printout of TAUOLA initialization variables, 
  added
2013.IV.20
- Prototype solution for matrix element based reweighting between Higgs 
  and Z/gamma production processes added. Checks are not completed.
2012.XII.12
- features documented in S. Banerjee et al  CERN-PH-TH-2012-347 made 
  into example. 
2012.XI.20 
- Thanks to Swagato Banerjee lack of numerical stability protection was spotted
  in weight calculation of TauSpinner for leptonic tau decays with 
  bremsstrahlung.
- Fix is installed, but code version of SVN revision 707 in LCG 
  is not free of the problem. 
2012.XI.19
- New functionality of TauSpinner finished
- Still  more tests need to be desined and performed
- but all basic ones seem to work OK. Physics content of nonSM 
  not tested, work on that is not completed. 

2012.XI.15
- New option for TauSpinner completed. Basic tests finished.
- Added option TauSpinner::set_nonSM_function(...) to set a user-provided
  function for user-defined born calculation.
- Added 'distr.f' to TauSpinner/examples as an example of use of the above
  method.
- Second new flag 'nonSMN' still must be checked.

2012.XI.06
- New option  dtrafted into TauSpinner. It is not checked at all.
  For the time being controlling parameter 'nonSM2=0' should be used,
  as in our tar-ball example 'tau-reweight-test.cxx'.
  Backward comatibility tests were performed. Note that new parameter
  supplement list of Tauspinner initialization method 'initialize_spinner()'

2012.VII.27
- version 1.1.0
- TauSpinner library merged with Tauola distribution
- Installation  of RChL currents prepared;     
  (.so or .a) library alone or all FORTRAN directory

2012.IV.30
- Tauolapp namespace introduced
- Communicate WARNING changed into WARNING from TAUOLA
- checks of forward declarations cleaned
- over all test on energy momentum conservation in a whole event added 
  to examples.
- checkMomentumConservation corrected to include energy as well
- version no moved from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7  

2011.XI.28
- Added example of using interface without HepMC
- Now interface can be compiled without HepMC by using:
  ./configure --without-hepmc

2011.XI.18
- Fixed bug in scripts located in platform/LCGCONFIG directory.
  It should have no effect on normal Tauola++ usage.
  However, when Tauola++ libraries are compiled using LCG scripts,
  some of the fortran routines used in user program may produce wrong results.

2011.VIII.22
- Several changes to documentation has been introduced, as requested by CPC Editor.
- Header files are now under '$prefix/include/Tauola' directory,
  changing include statements in all programs that use Tauola library.
- Fixed names of the '--with' parameters in default configuration files.
  Now all parameters are lower case.

2011.VII.10
- Bug in 'getZpolarization' where grandmother pdgid could become '-21' fixed.
  Thanks to Julia Yarba for pointing out this bug and detailed feedback about
  the cause.

2011.IV.29
- Method printing information on generated tau sample added Tauola::summary()

2011.IV.28:
- Fixed important kinematical mismatch in eta, k0 and pi0 decays.

2011.IV.04:
- work on release 1.0.4 completed
- note that temporarily SVN Revision: 499 from March 21 was marked as 
  release 1.0.4

2011.III.31:
- Fixed normalization for Plots for Fig3a and Fig4a
- documentation fine tunig completed
- Work on release 1.0.4 nearly completed, no changes to the code introduced.

2011.III.16:
- Added instalation scripts for LCG.

2011.III.7:
- Fixed problem with Tauola::setTaukle(...). Not working correctly.

2011.III.2:
- Fixed problem where calculation of mass of neutrino could result in NaN.
  Thanks to Peter Rosendahl for pointing out this bug.

2011.II.22:
- Changed names of three routines:
  Tauola::initialise -> Tauola::initialize
  Tauola::setInitialisePhy -> Tauola::setInitializePhy
  f_interface_tauolaInitialise -> f_interface_tauolaInitialize

  Wrappers for old names of these routines had been introduced
  for backward compatibility.

2011.I.30:
- updated documentation/readmes and makefiles for examples

2011.I.28:
- decayEndgame() is executed now when taus are boosted back to lab frame.
  Thanks to Sho Iwamoto for pointing out previously present bug resulting in 
 improper decay vertex position.

- several modifications to internal part of the interface  introduced
- unused files from 'examples' directory  moved to 'examples/attic'
- Separate executable for  'examples/testing'  introduced. That is why
   'examples/taumain_pythia_example.c' could be simplified.
- plot class has been rewritten and it's usage is modified/simplified
- added directory 'examples/testing/EW-PLOTS' for plots
  using/testing tables generated in SANC module

--
2011.I.13:
- several small bugs fixed thanks to feedback from Sho Iwamoto.

2010.VI.30:
- added routines to redefine tau decay channels on the flight
- added 4th example - taummk_pythia_example.c
- minor config modification (f77 + gcc34 and gfortran + gcc43 trick)

2010.II.24:
- functioning in case of cluster decaying into more than single tau-pair
  improved, but spin correlations not under contro. Case like  
  q bar q --> tau+ tau- nu_tau bar nu_tau g g gamma should be kept in mind.

2010.II.20:
- safety routines removed - bug in algorithm reducing multileg hard
  processes to Born kinematics hopefully fixed.

2010.II.13:
- safety routines added to src/TauolaParticlePair.cxx.  Their role is to 
  prevent segmentation
  fault if offending event content is encountered in execution. 
  Further work is expected. Input from program users
  is of the great help.
